The code can be downloaded for all platforms, but text-to-speech is Mac OS X only. There is a nasty bug preventing the program from exiting cleanly; I can't seem to stop the speech thread executing, despite trying lots of different code snippets. You'll need to use Ctrl+C to exit (yes, I know how bad this is).
